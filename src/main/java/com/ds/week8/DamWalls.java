	/*
	 * Your company is designing a dam to be built across a stream to create a small
	 * lake. To reduce materials cost, it will be made of one or more concrete walls
	 * with mud packed in between them. Determine the maximum height of the mud
	 * segments in the dam with the following restrictions:
	 * 
	 * One unit width of the gap between walls will contain one segment of packed
	 * mud The height of mud in a segment cannot exceed 1 unit more than an adjacent
	 * wall or mud segment.
	 * 
	 * Given the placement of a number of walls and their heights, determine the
	 * maximum height of a mud segment that can be built. If no mud segment can be
	 * built, return 0.
	 * 
	 * Example wallPositions = [1, 2, 4, 7] wallHeights = [4, 6, 8, 11]
